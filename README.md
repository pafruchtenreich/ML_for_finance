# ML for Portfolio Management and Trading
This repository is a project for ENSAE 24/25 course "ML for Portfolio Management and Trading". 
The goal is first to check if the decision announcements from the central banks (in this case the FED) are strong indicators to prediction the gold market movements. If not, we will actually analyze whether gold price contains information on central banks' future decisions.
Finally, we will conduct the same analysis between gold prices and the debt level in the US.
